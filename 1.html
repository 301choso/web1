<h3>Development</h3>
In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped<br>
ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee<br>
wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML<br>
<p style="margin-top:5px;">and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN<br>
data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the<br>
project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5]<br>
"some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>
